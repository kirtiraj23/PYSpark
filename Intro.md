## Introduction

#### BigData
##### - 
Data which easily can fit into your local system as per your scale like 0-64 GB of RAM,bt when you have larger datasets that you can't fit in your local Computer:--

When data is exceptionaaly huge then it can be managed in following ways:

1.Try usinga SQL database to move storage to Hard drive instead of RAM.

2. Or use a distributed system that distributes tha data to multiple machines

##### Advantages of distributing the data over didtributed Systems:-

1. A local Process will use the computation resources of a single machine, where a distributed process has access to computational resources across a number of machine connected through a network.

2. There will always be easy Scaling for distributed systems , you can just add more machines and increase the Space and Usage ,instead Single Computer will always have limited memory.

3. distributed system has a fault tolerance ,its like back up even if one system goes down, you will have one or many copies existing over the distributed network.


#### Hadoop
##### -
1. Hadoop is a way to distribute very large files across multiple machines.

2. It uses the Hadoop Distributed file system.

3. HDFS allows a user to work with large Data sets.

4. HDFS also dulplicates blocks of data for fault tolerance.

5. It also uses EMR,EMR does computation on that data.
